Heaps
=====

_High Performance Game Framework_

**Heaps** is a cross platform graphics engine designed for high performance games. It's designed to leverage modern GPUs that are commonly available on both desktop and mobile devices. The framework currently supports HTML5 WebGL, Flash Stage3D, native Mobile (iOS and Android) and Desktop with OpenGL.

Samples
-------

In order to compile the samples, go to the `samples` directory and run `haxe gen.hxml`, this will generate a `build` directory containing project files for all samples.

To compile:
- For JS/WebGL: run `haxe [sample]_js.hxml`, then open `index.html` to run
- For Flash: run `haxe [sample]_swf.hxml`, then open `<sample>.swf` to run
- For OpenFL/Lime: run `openfl test windows` into the sample directory

Project files for [HaxeDevelop](http://haxedevelop.org) are also generated
